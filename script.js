  "Youâ€™ve spoken into the universe with words wrapped in warmth, and somehow, they reached me.",
  "Not as noise. Not even as echo. But as meaning.",
  "You, with a voice that could convince even the stars to hum.",
  "With eyes that seem to notice the way petals lean into the wind.",
  "Thereâ€™s magic in people like you. Not the kind that shouts. The quiet kind.",
  "The kind that grows in hidden gardens and touches lives without asking anything in return.",
  "If birthdays are markers, then today marks more than time. It marks presence.",
  "The presence of someone who listens to the rhythm of life and chooses to add her own harmony.",
  "You may not always see what you spark, how your presence might nudge a soul back into writing",
  "how a laugh or a thought shared becomes someoneâ€™s turning point. But I see it. I felt it.",
  "You inspired me. And I wonder how many more youâ€™ve unknowingly moved.",
  "They say people like you are poems written by the universe and left behind as remindersâ€”of softness, strength, and beginnings.",
  "So let this be mine to you: A page offered on your day, filled with the echo of gratitude and something that could be hope.",
  "So hereâ€™s to you, Farahâ€”on this quiet, extraordinary day. You are not just celebrated. You are remembered, and more than thatâ€”you are heard."
